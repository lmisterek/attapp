## Description
This web application is intended for teachers to create a course, upload a list of students,
and a roster will be displayed on the screen.  Teachers may then select a class and take attendance
for the course.  The attendance history for each student is then recorded in a database.

## Demo

## Details for teaching team
Both jill@harvard.edu and jamal@harvard.edu work as users, but I did not seed students, courses,
and records for both Jill and Jamal.  Use Jill's username and password to see an example with courses, students, and records.

## Outside code
Many ideas were resourced from the following youtube videos, but each idea was adapted for my application.
